# <Mod 5 Challenge>

## Description 

For this project we are tasked in creating work schedule for the day with th feature of highlighting the current shift and hour highlighted.

At the same time learn how to implement local storage and fetch properties to the assigned div that does not end up being erased when reloaded.

## My Version

What I did differently different for this project, was that I added two types of time standards the 12 Hour and the 24 Hour.

Instead of hardcoding the hour divs, what I heard some of my peers did. I created the elements through a for loop. 
First in military time and then one for the 12 hour time.


I added a summary and detail element to collapse both tim schedule
## Issues With This Project

This project took a longer time to complete. This is because of my recent employment taking a rather large swathe of time for training.

*At first when trying to fetch the time I realized how JS read the time not as an array but as number value. As to why I started it under a 24 hour blocks.

* I am still trying to figure out how the aspect of local storage and printing to the body.

* I had a lot of help from Professor Gurmeet Singh to figure out the the last part of how to basically store into local storage. Although I think I was struggling for so long du to the fact my project was st up differently.

* I want to in the future add the same save to local storage function for the 12 hour version of the scheduler, but I would like to submit this for the time being. 


* Had to rehome another project: here is the original repo: https://github.com/mambrocio/api-scheduler
